# Smartspend

Welcome to SmartSpend, you very own **LOCAL** budgeting application!

## What is SmartSpend?

SmartSpend is an application that allowes to track your spending by:
1. logging payments to specific categories.
2. view graphs and spending in the past 7 days/ month.
3. Add new your very own categories to customize the app just for you!
4. view spending trajectory to see how your budget is going to look in the future.


## Future plans

Smart spend is written in flutter & dart, , it is currently on available for android, although we do
plan to add it to even more platforms in the future. We also plan to add more features to improve 
user experience, such as Bank integration, Spending analytics and behaviour predictions, and much more...

## How to use?

SmartSpend is very intuitive and self explanatory. Our best suggestion is to download the application
and try it out yourself. 

However, the main gist of it is: 
1. to create an account (which is local on your device, your information does not leave your device!). 
2. App has 4 default categories, which you can add more to, you adjust the spending limit for each category, as well as other settings.
3. Start logging payments in each category.
4. The app will do the rest!
